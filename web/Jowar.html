        </p>
        <p>
            Sorghum popularly known as jowar is the most important food and fodder crop of dry land agriculture. The cereal crop is perennial in nature and possessing corn like leaves and bearing the grain in a compact cluster. Sorghum is the fifth most important cereal crop in the world after wheat, rice, maize and barley.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sorghum is a genus of about 25 species of flowering plants in the grass family Poaceae. Some of these species have grown as cereals for human consumption and some in pastures for animals. One species, Sorghum bicolor, was originally domesticated in Africa and has since spread throughout the globe. Seventeen of the 25 species are native to Australia,[2][3] with the range of some extending to Africa, Asia, Mesoamerica, and certain islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.[4][5] One species is grown for grain, while many others are used as fodder plants, either cultivated in warm climates worldwide or naturalized in pasture lands.[6] Sorghum is in the subfamily Panicoideae and the tribe Andropogoneae (the tribe of big bluestem and sugarcane).

            Most varieties are drought- and heat-tolerant, and nitrogen-efficient,[12] and are especially important in arid regions, where the grain is one of the staples for poor and rural people. These varieties form important components of forage in many tropical regions. S. bicolor is an important food crop in Africa, Central America, and South Asia, and is the fifth-most important cereal crop grown in the world.
