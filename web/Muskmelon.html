        </p>
        <p>
            Muskmelon is a hot and dry season crop. The seed germinates best at the temperature of 28째C - 30 째C and grows well at 25째C - 35째C. It requires also plenty of sunshine. Continuous rain or high humidity will increase disease problem and reduce flowering and fruit setting.

            Cucumis melo, also known as melon,[2][3] is a species of Cucumis that has been developed into many cultivated varieties. The fruit is a pepo. The flesh is either sweet or bland, with or without a musky aroma, and the rind can be smooth (such as honeydew), ribbed (such as cantaloupe), wrinkled (such as casaba melon), or netted (such as muskmelon). In North America, the sweet-flesh varieties are often collectively called muskmelon, including the musky netted-rind varieties and the inodorous smooth-rind varieties,[4] and cantaloupe usually means the former type.[5] However, muskmelon in a narrow sense only refers to the musky netted-rind type, while the true cantaloupe is the European type with ribbed and often warty rind that is seldom grown in North America.[6]

            The origin of melons is not known. Research has revealed that seeds and rootstocks were among the goods traded along the caravan routes of the Ancient World. Some botanists consider melons native to the Levant and Egypt, while others place their origin in Iran,[7] India or Central Asia.[8] Still others support an African origin, and in modern times wild melons can still be found in some African countries.[9]
